\f0\fs24 \cf0 This page is intended to describe all of the electrical connection for the BF lens system.  Each lens system has its own switch box.  These switch boxes are identical and interchangeable.  Each contains a VGA input and a VGA output.  The box does nothing to the VGA signal except pick off the vertical retrace pulse at the end of each frame.  The box then uses this v-sync pulse to iterate through the lens control signals that are sent to FLC1 and FLC2.  \
\
Each of these boxes connects to the lenses through a T-junction.  The wire that is striped with white-out bands goes to FLC2.  (If the connections get reversed, then the system does not step through the focal powers sequentially.  Instead it does something like 1-3-2-4-1-3...  If in doubt, put up the demo image and move your head behind the lens, if the objects shift consistently, then its good, otherwise, the connection is reversed.)  \
\
Each of the switch boxes is triggered from the Trigger box.  This synchronizes the state in the lens cycle, 1-2-3-4, with the imagery via an illuminated square on the CRT which is switched on every 4th frame.  This allows the system to synchronize and recover from dropped frames.  If the photodiodes are not sensitive enough to pick up the flashing square, first, check that the photodiode is touching the display screen and is normal to the surface.  If its not working, then the sensitivity of the trigger box must be adjusted.  You'll find detailed instructions in a document saved to the subversion called "Photodiode box instructions.doc".  Please only change this box if you're sure its a sensitivity issue.  This means, that you have already checked the trigger signal with the oscilloscope and it is not sending a trigger pulse, no matter how you adjust the photodiode, and you have confirmed that the box is getting power.  \

[[Image:BF_wiring_diagram.jpg|center|alt=The picture of the electrical wiring map for the BF lens system|This shows the wiring for the BF display with the interlock system.  To add or edit this illustration, the pdf file is checked into the PTB layers directory with the software.]]\
\
Much of the complexity of this figure is caused by the interlock wiring.  This was an add-on to the system to prevent dammage to the lens system.  A DC signal to the lenses can damage the FLCs.  So it should not receive a DC voltage with a frequency less than 0.5 Hz.  The interlock box was designed by Larry Gibson, in the electronics shop to monitor the signals going to the lens and squelch the power if any gets a bad signal.  Which wire goes into which plugs is unimportant, but all 4 of the ports must be receiving an AC voltage if the box will provide steady power.  To start the system, press the "reset" button to temporarilly provide voltage despite a fault.  If its working, you'll see the current on the power supply jump from hundredths of an amp to about 0.47A.  \
\
Situations in which the interlock should cut the power\
# One or more of the plugs connecting the switch box to the computer comes unplugged.\
# One of the switch boxes becomes unplugged\
# The monitor goes to sleep\
# A white region that is on every frame covers the photodiode (like a screensaver, or a window)\
